# COVID-19 Confirmed Positive Cases Management System using Smartwatch and Hyperledger-fabric Blockchain Network for Data Integrity

Since the pandemic caused by COVID-19 has continued, the need for a system that can collect, safely store and search the movement and health information of confirmed patients has emerged. In particular, it is extremely important to block forgery/modification attempts caused by external intrusion and to keep data integrity. This software meets these needs.


# Architecture

The structure of this software can be described as follows.
그림

## Smartwatch

Smartwatches are great devices that can provide information on the movement of users. It can also measure the user's health information (heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar, step count, etc.) and transmit the data directly to the cloud server via Wi-Fi or cellular networks.
Currently, a watch application using Tizen-based Galaxy Watch 3 is implemented and uses the MQTT protocol.

## MQTT Broker & MQTT to REST Translator
The MQTT protocol is a popular protocol widely used for data transmission of IoT devices. MQTT can be used in high-performance devices such as smartphones as well as small devices without OS. In addition, it is supported by most commercial clouds (ex> Amazon AWS, MS Azure, etc.), so it has an advantage in terms of connectivity.
In this project, Mosquitto is used as MQTT Broker, and Mosquitto Configuration Files are provided for correct use.
In addition, this project supports MQTT to REST Translator to convert MQTT messages into REST API calls.

## Blockchain Network based on Hyperledger-Fabric

Blockchain network is an essential element to protect the security and integrity of data collected from users. In this project, a blockchain network is constructed using Hyperledger-Fabric, and Hyperledger-Composer is used to control this network. Hyperledger-Composer provides a REST API that supports secure addition, inquiry, and deletion of user data.

## Mobile App
Regardless of Android/iOS, data can be visualized using any mobile application that supports the MQTT protocol. Many of these applications have been uploaded to the App Store. The following applications are recommended for this project.


# Setup

## Open a file

You can open a file from **Google Drive**, **Dropbox** or **GitHub** by opening the **Synchronize** sub-menu and clicking **Open from**. Once opened in the workspace, any modification in the file will be automatically synced.

## Save a file

You can save any file of the workspace to **Google Drive**, **Dropbox** or **GitHub** by opening the **Synchronize** sub-menu and clicking **Save on**. Even if a file in the workspace is already synced, you can save it to another location. StackEdit can sync one file with multiple locations and accounts.

## Synchronize a file

Once your file is linked to a synchronized location, StackEdit will periodically synchronize it by downloading/uploading any modification. A merge will be performed if necessary and conflicts will be resolved.

If you just have modified your file and you want to force syncing, click the **Synchronize now** button in the navigation bar.

> **Note:** The **Synchronize now** button is disabled if you have no file to synchronize.

## Manage file synchronization

Since one file can be synced with multiple locations, you can list and manage synchronized locations by clicking **File synchronization** in the **Synchronize** sub-menu. This allows you to list and remove synchronized locations that are linked to your file.


# Publication

Publishing in StackEdit makes it simple for you to publish online your files. Once you're happy with a file, you can publish it to different hosting platforms like **Blogger**, **Dropbox**, **Gist**, **GitHub**, **Google Drive**, **WordPress** and **Zendesk**. With [Handlebars templates](http://handlebarsjs.com/), you have full control over what you export.

> Before starting to publish, you must link an account in the **Publish** sub-menu.

## Publish a File

You can publish your file by opening the **Publish** sub-menu and by clicking **Publish to**. For some locations, you can choose between the following formats:

- Markdown: publish the Markdown text on a website that can interpret it (**GitHub** for instance),
- HTML: publish the file converted to HTML via a Handlebars template (on a blog for example).

## Update a publication

After publishing, StackEdit keeps your file linked to that publication which makes it easy for you to re-publish it. Once you have modified your file and you want to update your publication, click on the **Publish now** button in the navigation bar.

> **Note:** The **Publish now** button is disabled if your file has not been published yet.

## Manage file publication

Since one file can be published to multiple locations, you can list and manage publish locations by clicking **File publication** in the **Publish** sub-menu. This allows you to list and remove publication locations that are linked to your file.


# Markdown extensions

StackEdit extends the standard Markdown syntax by adding extra **Markdown extensions**, providing you with some nice features.

> **ProTip:** You can disable any **Markdown extension** in the **File properties** dialog.


## SmartyPants

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|                |ASCII                          |HTML                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Single backticks|`'Isn't this fun?'`            |'Isn't this fun?'            |
|Quotes          |`"Isn't this fun?"`            |"Isn't this fun?"            |
|Dashes          |`-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash`|-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash|


## KaTeX

You can render LaTeX mathematical expressions using [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/):

The *Gamma function* satisfying $\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\quad\forall n\in\mathbb N$ is via the Euler integral

$$
\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.
$$

> You can find more information about **LaTeX** mathematical expressions [here](http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference).


## UML diagrams

You can render UML diagrams using [Mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/). For example, this will produce a sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob-->>John: How about you John?
Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
```

And this will produce a flow chart:

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Square Rect] -- Link text --> B((Circle))
A --> C(Round Rect)
B --> D{Rhombus}
C --> D
```
